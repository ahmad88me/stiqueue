# stiqueue
Stands for stick queue which is a simple messaging queue


# Run coverage
```sh run_coverage.sh```

# Run tests
```sh run_tests.sh```

*Note: the tests will use the default port and would
start and the server automatically, so you don't
need to run it before running the tests. Also note that
after running the tests, the operating system might take
a couple of seconds to release the port.*
